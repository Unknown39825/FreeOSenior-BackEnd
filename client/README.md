# FreeOSenior

**SENIORS are NEVER FAR, the MATERIAL is NEVER LESS, QUERIES can be SOLVED, the CONNECTIVITY will NEVER MESS.**
FreeOSenior is the Platform through which seniors can share their valuable knowledge, material, free courses info, assignments etc. when juniors come through different problems faced in daily college life. Moreover they can ask their doubts about different jargons they came across in their academics. Seniors will get an easy access to juniors on any kind of promotions or they will get the popularity points for the same. Seniors can also segregate juniors on the basis of technicality and other skills for making teams etc.

## The Idea

The basic idea is to create a _platform for the different sections of juniors_ (based on skills like competitive programming, IOT etc) no matter where they are and who they are just provide a platform to ensure they get to connect with the seniors of their type, their level of intelligence and hence perceive a great access to things. In the current situation(COVID-19) this platform can be a great help to freshers.

## Vision

Hello!!

**Ever thought about getting already made assignments by the seniors? Ever thought of the resources your seniors used? Ever thought of connecting peeps with the same interests and same level of thinking? Ever tried to get everything related to academics, skills etc. in few clicks?
Oreverfaced some problems in your academics or college life and there was no one around to guide you??? Or taken one on the reference of a friend, only to have the guide leave you stranded in the middle of research.**

Well, we've faced the same problems too. And we decided to help fix it. So we've created FreeOSenior, a place for all types of guidance and knowledge. It's very simple: You enter yourbranch , yourneed and yourskills. We would analyze authenticity and aptitude through our resources categorize you. We will provide you every help and many more users with same goal as yours .! It's that simple!

Everybody will have the access to the assignments and works your seniors have done in the previous year for reference. From the code they used in their project Psd files of fests of posters.
